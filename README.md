## Overview

In this project the challenge is to build a profile card component and I did so using simple HTML 5 and CSS 3 technology.

### The challenge

To acheive the positioning of the background element, I had to use pseudo elements 'before' and 'after' to achieve it. Also for positioning elements in the right places I employed flexbox and CSS grid to acheive that. I would say this was quite challenging and satisfying because I was able to complete the task at hand.
